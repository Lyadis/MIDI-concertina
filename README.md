# MIDI-concertina


This is The Github project wich his a personnal work about Making an electronic version of my concertina,
Goal is to play by night with my headphones for my neighboors and maybe with my band BernyTradSchool

Arduino =>( midi library )  Serial port ( hairless midi serial ) => midi port ( loopMidi ) => Fruity Loops / Ableton / ...

We chose this solution because it's the most generic you can interface with 

I use two arduinos (uno and nano) 

With MIDILibrary (very easy to use for outputs)

Good for interface with a virtual midi port and to test while developing
